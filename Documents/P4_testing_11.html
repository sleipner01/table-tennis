        <br><h2>Testing Document</h2>
        <p>
            We decided to use live testing of our website to get insight of how users would interact with the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            We did not create any a google form to send out as we decided live testing was a better way of gaining
            insight.
        </p>
        <p>
            The subjects used their own devices so that we would get a varied number of testing
            platforms inclouding mobile.
        </p>
        <p>
            We used a couple of general questions for our subjects while doing live testing
            if they did not know what to look for. These questions are listed below:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Are you intersted in table tennis?</li>
            <li>How is the usability of the website?</li>
            <li>Is it easy to navigate on the page?</li>
            <li>Does the content match the subject of the website?</li>
            <li>Is it easy to find and access contact information?</li>
            <li>Are there any functions you miss?</li>
            <li>How do the existing functionality work for you?</li>
            <li>How would you rate the professionalism of the site?</li>
            <li>Is there a clear cut usage the website fills?</li>
            <li>How do you feel about the structure and design of the website?</li>
            <li>What catches your eyes first?</li>
            <li>Do the color palates fit the page?</li>
            <li>Is there a clear "call to action" on every page?</li>
            <li>Does the website work well on your platform?</li>
            <li>Final thoughts?</li>
        </ol>


        <br><h2>Testing Audience</h2>
        <p>
            We conducted live testing at NTNU, with contestants studying informatics and computer enginering.
        </p>
        <p>
            We focused on getting feedback from experienced programmers, student assistants and masters students.
        </p>
        <p>
            This worked out great and we got insight from well versed programmers. It consisted of 100% college students.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of those students were 14% student assistants and 14% master students. We also asked if the students where
            intersested in table tennis and therefore in the intended audience. Out of the test subjects, 42% were interested in table tennis.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, the site was tested by all of our parents. We did this to get feedback on the site from people not in NTNU's environment.
        </p>

        <br><h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
        <p>
           We got a bunch of feedback from the live testing we conducted, both criticism and praise. The general consensus was very positive.
        </p>
        <p>
           The page worked well on all platforms and dimensions. The usability of the site is great, but there were complaints
           about the visabilty of the navbar at the top of the page. Due to the black color of these icons some users where not able to see and
           therfore not able to use this navbar. In this case it was far more visible in dark mode.
        </p>
        <p>
           The testers enjoyed the current functions, espesiclly darkmode, and had no need for any new ones.
        </p>
        <p>
           The color scheme of black and red representing the table tennis colors were appreciated and the validation
           on the contact page worked well. However the page does not react in any big way to users giving an input and serving that input. Testers wished
           for some sort of feedback when sending in the contact form. (We conducted testing before this functionality was fully implemented, and have of course added it, as we always planned to do.)
        </p>
        <p>
           The calendar got a lot of praise and the website had a lot of useful content.
        </p>
        <p>
           Some users also complained that the links in the footer of the page where not set to <code>target="_blank"</code> and also suggested that the
           home page could lead dircetly to the content, skipping the image gallery and the NTNUI Table Tennis logo, making the page even more usable.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have to account for slight bias on our parents feedback, but the feedback were good. Noteworthy are Magnus' parents lack of techological understanding. 
            However, they managed to navigate the site without problems and were surprisingly happy with the user experience.
            The remaining constructive feedback from our parents is already covered.
        </p>

        <br><h2>Your Response</h2>
        <p>
            The feedback we got was mostly positive so there was not a great amount of change needed. We did respond to the feedback we got
            and thought about differnet ways we could implement improvements to the site based on the insight we got from live testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The important change we had to do was changing the color-behavior of the navbar to make it more visible and usable. 
            Our indented animation where the navbar buttons kept a white background for a sertain amount of time, before fading to transparent background, didn't work as we had hoped. 
            For new users, the animation wasn't clear enough since they had to analyze and process everything they were greeted with when visiting the page for the first time.
            It resulted in them not understanding where the hamburger-menu were located since the transparent background made the menu blend in with the gallery at the index page.
            Therefore we assigned a static white background to the navbar icons making them visible to the users.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second feedback we addressed was the wished for the contact form to be more interactive. As this feature was already in the making, we got it finished and released it on the site the same day.
        </p>
        <p>
            We fixed the usability issue of the links on the bottom of the page by making them open in a new tab.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final suggestion we looked in to was the idea of the page leading directly to content, skipping the image gallary and the header. We concluded that the gallery was a needed part
            of the web page as this is a landing zone for the whole site. Also, we had useful information, like the name of the group/site, and a "call to actiion button" guiding regular users to the feature they most often will use - the calendar.
            However, we styled the page in a way that the image gallery almost never will fill the whole screen, and let some information beneath the gallery come into view.
        </p>
        <p>
            We could have created a cookies for directing the page directly to the content, but we deemed giving the user a clear cut depiction of the subject of the page trough the header as more important.
        </p>

        <br><h2>Self-reflection</h2>
        <p>     
            We feel that we have gotten a better grasp on the amount of time polishing a website takes, from pretty css gimmicks, to using js so the site feels more alive.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition we have learned that testing different design options, and functionality tricks will also always happen in the "coding" phase of the proess, no matter how intricately you design something.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is interesting how much our different solutions implementations differ. For instance just trying to edit the js that Ole wrote required some of us to read up on a whole book's worth of syntax and special methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            For some of us, Git was completely new. However, we agreed to use it, to force ourselves to learn it properly. Even though it is not part of this course, we are really happy we used it. We have come to realize how powerful it is.
            It helped us track bad changes, and solve problems in no time. Also, being able to create different branches to test ideas with was good. 
            Some changes required a lot more editing than what first met the eye, so without branches, any discarded feature would definately have left behind a chaos of some nasty bugs and unused elements.
            For instance, Magnus "simple", pure CSS, parrallax effect on the index gallery. It required the whole index page to be restructured and a mess in the css file. The feature was discarded...:)
        </p>
        <p>
            Over all we really do feel like this was a fun project, where we get to show off our creative sides, as well as just creating something from scratch being very fun.
        </p>
