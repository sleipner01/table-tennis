                            <p> The equipment consists of 3 components: a ball, table and rackets. The international rules specifies that the ball has a diameter of 40 millimeters. The table is 2.74 m long, 1.525 m wide, 76 cm high, and in the middle there is a net at 15.25 cm in height. Players are equipped with a wooden racket usually covered with rubber. The rubber provides various levels of spin or speed, and in some cases they nullify spin.</p>

                            <h2>Rules</h2>
                            <p>According to ITTF rules the first service is decided by a coin toss (A common method for casual games is “serve to play”). In game play, the player serving the ball commences a play. the receiver must hit the ball back before it bounces a second time on receiver's side of the table so that the ball passes the net and touches the opponent's court, either directly or after touching the net.
                            <br><br>Thereafter, the server and receiver must alternately make a return until the rally is over. A game shall be won by the player first scoring 11 points unless both players score 10 points, then the game shall be won by the first player subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points.</p>

                            <h2>Beginner tips</h2>
                            <p>One of the most normal mistake a beginner make is that they try to learn complex serves or shots before having the fundamentals right. Be sure to nail down the basics and spend some time just knocking the ball on the table consistently before moving on to more complex techniques.
                            <br><br>Another mistake beginners make is that they neglect footwork. One of the keys to playing a good game of table tennis is having good footwork. Proper footwork would allow you to move more efficiently such that you would be able to execute better, more accurate returns.
                            <br><br>Our last tip for beginners is to have fun! There is no point on going to practice and trying to improve if you do not enjoy it.</p>
